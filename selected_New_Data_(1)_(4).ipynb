        "## 1. Model Selection Rationale\n",
        "For this project, we selected **`google/flan-t5-base`** as our foundation model. This decision was driven by the following technical and practical constraints:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Hardware Limits:**\n",
        "    The `flan-t5-base` model has approximately **250 million parameters**. This size is optimal for the **Google Colab (T4 GPU)** environment available to us. Larger models (like Llama-2-7b or Mistral) would require significant quantization (4-bit) and might lead to OOM (Out of Memory) errors during gradient checkpointing, whereas T5 fits comfortably in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Time Constraints:**\n",
        "    As an Encoder-Decoder architecture, T5 is highly efficient for Sequence-to-Sequence tasks. Its smaller footprint allows for **faster training epochs** and quicker inference times compared to Decoder-only LLMs. This enables rapid iteration and debugging within the tight deadlines of the graduation project milestones.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Dataset Size:**\n",
        "    Our initial dataset for this milestone is small. T5 is known for its **sample efficiency** and ability to generalize well on supervised fine-tuning tasks without requiring the massive datasets typically needed to align larger Large Language Models (LLMs).\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Expected Difficulty:**\n",
        "    The task involves generating descriptive text based on inputs (captioning/description). T5 is natively pre-trained on a \"text-to-text\" framework, making it naturally aligned with this objective. This reduces the complexity of the fine-tuning process compared to adapting a general-purpose causal language model.\n",
